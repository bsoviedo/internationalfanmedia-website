              The protection of personal data of children and adolescents is of
              particular concern to INTERNATIONAL FAN MEDIA, SL. The
              INTERNATIONAL FAN MEDIA, SL Platforms and their content are not
              directed at children under the age of thirteen (13). INTERNATIONAL
              FAN MEDIA, SL recommends that parents discuss the use of the
              Internet and the provision of personal data on websites with their
              children before allowing minors between thirteen (13) and sixteen
              (16) to register.
              <br />
              <br />

              data from or about children under thirteen (13) or knowingly allow
              minors between thirteen (13) and sixteen (16) to register as users
              without parental permission. If a parent or legal guardian becomes
              aware that his or her child under sixteen (16) has registered as a
              user without their consent, he or she should delete the relevant
              account or if this is not possible, inform INTERNATIONAL FAN
              MEDIA, SL immediately. If INTERNATIONAL FAN MEDIA, SL becomes
              aware that a child under thirteen (13) or between thirteen (13)
              and sixteen (16) but without parental permission has registered as
              a INTERNATIONAL FAN MEDIA, SL user, their access as a user will
              immediately be denied and their account deleted as quickly as
              possible (including all personal data associated with that
              account).
              <br />
              <br />

              personal data from or about a child under thirteen (13), please
              notify INTERNATIONAL FAN MEDIA, SL in writing by email.
